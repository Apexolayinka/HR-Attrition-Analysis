# HR-Attrition-Analysis
This project takes a deep dive into HR dataset using Power Bi to identify problems relating to attrition in an organization, thereby, providing analysis and also giving possible recommendations.
## Aim of this Project
This project is aimed to proffer answer to the following questions
- Total number of employee
- Current number of employee
- Total number of attrition (attrition count)
- Rate of attrition
- Attrition by department
- Attrition by education field
- Attrtion by gender
## Tools used
1. Power Query plus DAX formulas: Added a conditional column to determine the attrition count, removed some columns that are not needed for the analysis.
2. Power Bi: Used for visualization and dashboard creation
## Analysis
There were 1470 employees in the organization, 237 left, thereby, reducuing the numbers to 1233. Therefore, there are 1233 employees in the organization currently. 
Attrition rate is pegged at 16.12%. 
Attrition occurs the most amongst employees between the ages of 25 and 35 years with a total of 112 employees; 43 females and 69 males while attrition occurs the least amongst the old employees between the ages of 55 and above. Young staffs especially the males, are often motivated by higher pay, hence, they find it difficult to stay commited to the same job for a long time.
